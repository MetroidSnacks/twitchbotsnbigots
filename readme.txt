This is a collection of bot account names
NamelistMASTER contains all the names we reccomend you ban in your channel
Sometimes people get on that list by accident, in that case they will be removed from the namelist and put into the False-positive list so you can unban them
I've created a "How to" Video on the FileDifference and how to use the files.
